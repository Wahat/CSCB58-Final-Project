Proposal
--------

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?:

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?:

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?:

What is your backup plan if things don’t work out as planned?

What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board
(be sure to e-mail Brian if it’s anything beyond the basics to make sure there’s enough to go around)

Updates
-------

<Example update. Delte this and add your own updates after each lab session>
Week 1: We built the hardware and tested the sensors. The distance sensor we had intended to use didn't work as
expected (wasn't precise enough at further distances, only seems to work accurately within 5-10cm), so instead
we've decided to change the project to use a light sensor instead. Had trouble getting the FSM to work (kept
getting stuck in state 101, took longer to debug than expected), so we may not be able to add the
high score feature, have updated that in the project description as (optional).

Week 1: We finalized on our idea, figured out game logic and prepared for planning modules we might need in the future.
The control, datapath and top level modules have been built and modified for our project. However, our actual game modules
will be completed later on. For this week, we will be working on our start game, end game (winning and losing scores),
and ball collision modules for testing in the next lab in order to see if our idea works before spending time on the other modules.
One problem we are having is determining how the ball will bounce accordingly each block but hopefully it will be solved by over
the next week.
