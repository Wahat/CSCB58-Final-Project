Updates

<Example update. Delte this and add your own updates after each lab session>
Week 1: We built the hardware and tested the sensors. The distance sensor we had intended to use didn't work as
expected (wasn't precise enough at further distances, only seems to work accurately within 5-10cm), so instead
we've decided to change the project to use a light sensor instead. Had trouble getting the FSM to work (kept
getting stuck in state 101, took longer to debug than expected), so we may not be able to add the
high score feature, have updated that in the project description as (optional).
