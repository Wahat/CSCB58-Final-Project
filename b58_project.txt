Proposal
--------

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?:
What we plan to finish is the top level entity and begin work on our supporting game modules

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?:
What we plan to finish is game logic and the overall look of the game

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?:
What we plan to

What is your backup plan if things don’t work out as planned?
Our backup plan is to implement on the dot runner game and add more obstacles

What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board?
(be sure to e-mail Brian if it’s anything beyond the basics to make sure there’s enough to go around)
We might need to use a keyboard later on as we could run out of inputs

Updates
-------
Week 1: We finalized on our idea, figured out game logic and prepared for planning modules we might need in the future.
The control, datapath and top level modules have been built and modified for our project. However, our actual game modules
will be completed later on. For this week, we will be working on our start game, end game (winning and losing scores),
and ball collision modules for testing in the next lab in order to see if our idea works before spending time on the other modules.
One problem we are having is determining how the ball will bounce accordingly each block but hopefully it will be solved by over
the next week.

Week 2:
We begun working deciding on the overall visuals of the project. Most of the backend game logic has been finished but we ran into
a couple of problems such as how to display certain elements and how to control user input. We realized we ran out of keys for user
input and we might have to use a keyboard for additional keys for controlling the block placer. This week we will finish the placing
block modules and put the visuals into place. Some problems I see may occur in the future will be how we allow the user to place the blocks.
The blocks may over lap and glitch the game or the ball might go through the block but I hope to fix this problem during week 3.
